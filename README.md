This is a deck simulator for a school project. It is not maintained anymore. Code is abismal and was very rushed, good thing that none of the teachers could review that.

App contains around 500 cards with questions in the largest deck.

App is built with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/). Feel free to open it in the editor and poke around.

Some extra tooling was built using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) is required to build it, but it is not required 
to run the project, only to create the deck resource.

Latest release ([1.4](https://github.com/IwailerI/school-pddr-deck/releases/latest)) has only the English deck. 
Previous release ([1.3](https://github.com/IwailerI/school-pddr-deck/releases/1.3)) has both English and Russian decks, along with some funny development decks.

There is not documentation, so good luck!
